#### Open/Unsealed Auction
Other auction such as Ascending Price Auction (APA) or Deferred Revelation Action (DRA) are also well-discussed in recent literature [1]

We first implement Ascending Auction where the auction is closed when no higher bid is submitted. During bidding procedure, each bidder can observe the latest bid (or the highest bid) and can choose whether to submit a higher bid with minimal increase.
